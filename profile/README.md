# Welcome to `EpicOutliers`

The `EpicOutliers` is a hub for useful resources for future statisticians at Stanford University.
Although the material here is generally catered towards statistics Ph.D. students in our department,
anyone is welcome to view the material and possibly contribute.

This organization grew out of a collaboration among a few outliers to create a set of solutions for Amir Dembo's Probability Theory notes ([STATS310-Dembo-Solutions](https://github.com/EpicOutliers/STATS310-Dembo-Solutions) __(private)__).
We realized that the first-year students can benefit greatly from this full set of solutions, as STATS310 can be quite daunting.
Beyond solution sets, we also observed that there was a lack of a central source for notes.
Many students end up writing their own set of notes, which certainly has merits for self-edification purposes, 
but a lot of time can still be saved if people could contribute to __a few__ polished set of notes.
This repository also welcomes any research-related material. 
For example, a list of important papers in a certain area to get quickly acclimated to the material.

For suggestions on improving this repository, submit a PR [here](https://github.com/EpicOutliers/.github/pulls). Things like "I wish we had ABC resources" or "There's a typo in XYZ" are all welcome!

We hope this helps you on your journey to becoming an epic outlier!
